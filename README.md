What is ImageCoin?
----------------

ImageCoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world, sign images. ImageCoin uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. ImageCoin Core is the name of open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

Building process
-----------------

**compiling ImageCoin from git**

Use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Always verify the signatures and checksums.


Development tips and tricks
---------------------------

**payload for img**

Message

* `m:Example message! `
* ` m:Hello!`

Message and Image/Video

* `mimg:Example message!:img:base64 `
* `mimg:Hello!:img:iVdnUwACAAAAAAAAAAAfm5nB6slBlZ3Fch.`.

Image/Video
* `iVdnUwACAAAAAAAAAAAfm5nB6slBlZ3Fch..`

**compiling for debugging**

Run configure with the --enable-debug option, then make. Or run configure with
CXXFLAGS="-g -ggdb -O0" or whatever debug flags you need.

**debug.log**

If the code is behaving strangely, take a look in the debug.log file in the data directory;
error and debugging message are written there.

The -debug=... command-line option controls debugging; running with just -debug will turn
on all categories (and give you a very large debug.log file).

The Qt code routes qDebug() output to debug.log under category "qt": run with -debug=qt
to see it.

**testnet and regtest modes**

Run with the -testnet option to run with "play ImageCoin" on the test network, if you
are testing multi-machine code that needs to operate across the internet.

If you are testing something that can run on one machine, run with the -regtest option.
In regression test mode blocks can be created on-demand; see qa/rpc-tests/ for tests
that run in -regtest mode.

**DEBUG_LOCKORDER**

ImageCoinCore is a multithreaded application, and deadlocks or other multithreading bugs
can be very difficult to track down. Compiling with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER (configure
CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER -g") inserts run-time checks to keep track of what locks
are held, and adds warning to the debug.log file if inconsistencies are detected.
